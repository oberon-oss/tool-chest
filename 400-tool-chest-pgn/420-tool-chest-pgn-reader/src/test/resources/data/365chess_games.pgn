1. d4 {In this game, I came straight from teaching to the chess match,
arriving 20 minutes late. Thankfully I still managed to win!} d5 {Prior
to this game, I had had a string of games where I had played badly. I was
delighted to get back to playing something more like what I am capable
of!} 2. c4 {So it's a Queen's Gambit.} c6 {Slav variation.} 3. Nf3 {I avoid
the Slav Gambit.} Nf6 {He develops.} 4. Nc3 {And we reach the usual position
in the Slav.} Bg4 {Aggressively attacking my knight.} 5. Ne5 {So I move
threatening to take his bishop.} Bf5 {The bishop retreats.} 6. Qb3 {I hit
b7. I think Qb6 is now his best bet, but he tried.....} b6 {This leaves
his c6 pawn very weak, for instance if Nb8 moves, c6 falls.} 7. Bg5 {I
think he panicked a a bit at this moment, thinking that I was threatening
to take on f6 followed by taking on d5. However if he takes back with a
pawn, I can't take on d5 as my Ne5 would have been attacked.} Nfd7 {This
just drops a pawn.} 8. cxd5 {So I take.} Nxe5 {He takes.} 9. dxe5 {I take
back.} Qc7 {He attacks e5.} 10. Bf4 {I protect it.} f6 {Threatening to
take on e5 again.} 11. e4 {So I attack his bishop, opening up a diagonal
for my Bf1.} Bg6 {His bishop drops back.} 12. dxc6 {I take.} Bf7 {Ok, stop.
What would you play here as white and why?} 13. Qxf7+ {Did you find this?}
Kxf7 {He takes back. Now what?} 14. e6+ {Did you find this? It at least
gets the queen back.} Kxe6 {He decides to have a pawn. What would you play
now as white?} 15. Bc4# {Did you stop this? Why take a queen when you can
have a king! Many thanks for reading. Please leave a comment or two and
rate the annotation on the star system, to let me know how I am getting
on. Until next time dear reader!}  1-0
